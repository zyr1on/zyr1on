```c
I have been dealing with cyber security(main) and software development for a long time. (Mostly C/C++ and Python)
I want to gain experience with pentesting and C++.
I am also interested in embedded systems, IoT hacking, gaming and graphic programming.
And I love anything involving math and philosophy.
